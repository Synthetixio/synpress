# Platform Compatibility

::: warning
While in **alpha**, the compatibility of Synpress is limited, but we're working hard to support more frameworks and platforms as soon as possible.
:::

Synpress, in its current state, is compatible with Playwright (>=1.39.0) only and requires Node 18+. Synpress is compatible with MacOS and Linux.

## Supported CI Providers

::: info
We have yet to test any other CI provider than GitHub Actions. However, Synpress should work on all of them. If you encounter any issues, please let us know!

## Windows

Currently, Synpress is not compatible with Windows. In the meantime, we recommend using WSL.

If you're knowledgeable about working with Windows and the Node.js environment, and you'd like to help us make Synpress compatible with Windows, please reach out to us on our Discord.
