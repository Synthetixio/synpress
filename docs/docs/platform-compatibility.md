# Platform Compatibility

::: warning
While in **alpha**, the compatibility of Synpress is limited, but we're working hard to support more frameworks and platforms as soon as possible.
:::

Synpress, in its current state, is only compatible with Playwright (>=1.39.0) and requires Node 18+. Synpress is compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux. 

## Supported CI Providers

::: info
We have yet to test any other CI provider than GitHub Actions. However, Synpress should work on all of them. If you encounter any issues, please let us know!
:::

::: tip
See the [CI](./guides/ci) section for more information about how to set up Synpress on CI.
